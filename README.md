# terraform-aws-ec2-template

A reusable Terraform module to create an EC2 instance in AWS, and group to an application dashboard.

## Getting Started

See the `example` directory for a working demo of the module.

Note: This README is a work in progress and will be updated as the module is developed further and
in a state I'm happy with.
