## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to run the module:

- A CloudFlare account with a domain which the subdomain record will be created in
- An existing SSH public key
- (Optional) A 1Password account to utilise the provided `Makefile` commands

Note: This README is a work in progress and will be updated as the module is developed further and
in a state I'm happy with.
